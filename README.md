# Transform-Day-time-to-night-time-images-for-Autonomous-Drive
Assuming to develop new software around automated detection of cars, pedestrians at all conditions for autonomous drive. One major bottleneck is data collection under severe weather conditions, especially capturing night-time images. So this project is to generate night time equivalent images from daytime images, such that we have access to some outdoor images acquired at night and some at day, but no pairwise images are available.

In this project we implement CycleGAN using Keras with the intention to transform Day time to night time images for Autonomous Drive like in:
